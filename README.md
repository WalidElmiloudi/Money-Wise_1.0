## About

Money-Wise is a lightweight finance management tool designed for individuals who want a **simple, self-hosted solution** to track incomes and expenses.  

It’s now **refactored using Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)**, with:

- **Namespaced classes** 
- **Singleton Database class** for shared PDO connection  
- **Composer PSR-4 autoloading** for clean and modular code  

The goal is to keep things minimal yet functional, making it easy to understand, customize, and run on any standard PHP-capable environment.
